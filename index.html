      <p>No kingdom. No memories. After a 100-year slumber, Link wakes up alone in a world he no longer remembers. Now the legendary hero must explore a vast and dangerous land and regain his memories before Hyrule is lost forever.
Armed only with what he can scavenge, Link sets out to find answers and the resources needed to survive.</p>
      <p>When Link first wakes up, he’s unarmed and defenseless. Relying on his wits and resourcefulness, though, he can acquire over 180 different weapons to use in combat. These items will wear out over time, though, so he must always be on the lookout for more.
There’s more to fighting than just weapons, of course. Link will also have to learn a variety of different attacks—like high-flying bow shots and making use of explosives—in order to prevail.</p>
